# Chess Analysis

This project is a first test of evalution for chess games. The goal here is simple: determine what is the best option to start a match and win it.

Based on a small sample of data, we'll analyze further the impact of plays and responses from white and black pieces to solve some other little questions, such as:
- What is the best opening for white?
- And the response of black pieces?
- What are the most successful openings?
- And finally, how to determine the best first move for both sides to win the match, based on machine learning?

Some preview about the information on this project:
